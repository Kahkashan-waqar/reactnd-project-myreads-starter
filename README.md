# MyReads Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

MyReads is just like a books library where we can seacrh and manange the books. This webpage consist of two pages, first page you see is the main page where you have three portions for books currently reading, want to read or read. The second page is the search page where you can search for additional books. On both pages there is a dropdown to select the shelve.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.
